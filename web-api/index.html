    <p>Regarding the challenges you might face when trying to get back a response, one common issue is dealing with
        Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). CORS is a security feature implemented by web browsers to restrict web
        pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page.</p>

    <p>If the HTTPS endpoint you're trying to access is on a different domain than the one your JavaScript code is
        running on, you may encounter CORS restrictions. In such cases, the server must include the appropriate CORS
        headers in its response to allow your web page to access the data.</p>

    <p>These headers include:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Access-Control-Allow-Origin:</strong> Specifies which origins are allowed to access the resource.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Access-Control-Allow-Methods:</strong> Specifies the HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST) allowed when
            accessing the resource.</li>
        <li><strong>Access-Control-Allow-Headers:</strong> Specifies which HTTP headers can be used when making the
            actual request.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If the server does not include these headers, or if they do not permit your domain, the browser will block the
        request, and you may not be able to retrieve the data. In such situations, you might need to contact the server
        administrator to configure CORS properly or consider alternative solutions like JSONP, proxy servers, or
        server-side adjustments.</p>
