### Problem Solving 1
1. For Problem Solving 1.1 and 1.2 i have used solutions in **PHP**Â and **Javascript** 
2. Solutions are inside folder ***problem-solving*** 
    - PHP functions are inside [solution.php](problem-solving/solution.php)
    - JS functions are inside [js/script.js](problem-solving/js/script.js)
3. Just for PHP used docker-compose.yml which must need dockers in the machine and after running we can access php solutions by localhost:8000/solution.php
